## Additional commitments

- Each project completed should be shared, on social media, promoting both hashtags #100DaysOfCode and #100DaysOfVue, with a brief summary of what was learned.
- Each project should be ended within the time suggested. Consider how much hours do you need each day to reach the goal.
- All images in each project should be uploaded with SVG format (except favicons).
- Each project can be use a CSS framework to shorten the developing time, also a CSS pre-processor. There are no limitations in which framework can be used.
- All projects can be developed using [Flat Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design), [Material Design](https://material.io/design/), or whatever UI pattern design you want, but you must be consistent in which pattern design you choose. I mean, if the first project you completed (whatever it was) you made it on a Material Design, you should complete all remaining projects in that UI pattern design.

Good luck and may the force be with you!!
