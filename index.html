    <h2>Projects suggested</h2>
    <p>
      All projects listed here are optional, so you can feel free to get rid of
      some of those projects and make others either way.
    </p>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <p><em>(*) but it is also a pun in Spanish</em>&nbsp;ðŸ˜‰</p>
    <h2>Additional commitments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each project completed should be shared, on
        social media, promoting both
        hashtags <span class="tag">#100DaysOfCode</span> and <span class="tag">#100DaysOfVue</span>,
        with a brief summary of what was learned.</li>
      <li>Each project should be ended within the
        time
        suggested. Consider how
        much hours
        do you need each day to reach the goal.</li>
      <li>All images in each project should be
        uploaded on SVG format (except favicons).</li>
      <li>Each project can be use a CSS framework to
        shorten the developing time, also a
        CSS pre-processor. There are no limitations in which framework can be
        used.</li>
      <li>All projects can be developed using <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design"
          target="_blank"
        >Flat
          Design
        </a>, <a
          href="https://material.io/design/"
          target="_blank"
        >Material
          Design</a>, or whatever UI pattern design you
        want,
        but you must be consistent in which pattern design you choose. I mean,
        if the
        first project you completed (whatever it was) you made it on a Material
        Design,
        you should complete all remaining projects in that UI pattern design.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Good luck and May the force be with you! ðŸ˜Œ</p>
